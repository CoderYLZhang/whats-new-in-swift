# `countElements()` is now `count()`

In Swift 1.0 you would count an array like this:
*/
let items = [1, 2, 3]
println(countElements(items))
/*:
The `countElements()` function has been renamed to `count()` in Swift 1.1, so the new code is this:
*/
let items = [1, 2, 3]
println(count(items))
/*:
- important:  This has changed in later versions of Swift – `count` is now a property of strings and collections.
